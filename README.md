**OPEN THE WEBSITE IN INCOGNITO WINDOW ONLY**

The Home page has been made using colorlib, **do not** remove the copyright at the bottom (legal reasons). Please create pages for 'Team', 'Aakashvani' etc.
Dont be afraid to change up the html/css/js files and explore :smiley:.

**Instructions and Pull Request Policy:**
1. Clone the repository using link or download and extract zip file.
2. **CREATE A NEW BRANCH** (ensure that this branch is selected whenever you edit).
3. Django Setup (Optional): Run the following commands inside the main folder using Command Prompt:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py runserver`

(`Ctrl-C` to close the server)

Edit the html files present in `agApp/templates` as well
as any of the css/scss/js files in `static` folder. Ignore the html files present in the `static` folder as they are not linked to Django. You may view the `static/index.html` and `static/example.html` but there is no point editing them.

4. **Only** if you do not have python: you may edit any of the files in the `static` folder. `example.html` is a default example provided by colorlib and `index.html` is a homepage created using it. You can open these files by double clicking and edit using any editor you have.

5. Once u have added some code, stage all changes and commit with meaningful message.
6. Push everytime you commit, you can commit multiple times.
7. If you feel your code has some significant development,
   contact one of the admins who will merge with main branch,
   **DO NOT** merge or pull request by yourself.
